Project files:
README -  this file
linewindowz.pro - idl procedure file
atmosphereplot.data - ascii file modelling atmospheric transmission at ALMA site assuming 1.0 mm PWV. Generated by ALMA atmosphere calculator

To use, call linewindowz from IDL. Procedure documentation may be viewed from within IDL (IDL> doc_library, "linewindowz")
The atmosphere ascii file is necessary only if a transmission plot overlay is desired.
